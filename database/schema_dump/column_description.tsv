table	column	type	description
amino_acid_symbol	name	character varying(16)	Full name of the amino acid
amino_acid_symbol	symbol_3letter	character(3)	Three letter symbol of the amino acid
amino_acid_symbol	symbol_1letter	character(1)	Single letter symbol of the amino acid
annotation  key bigint	Mutation id. This can be joined 'key' column in the 'vcf_key' table.
annotation	annotation_impact	USER-DEFINED	Annotation Impact
annotation	gene_name	USER-DEFINED	Gene Name
annotation	feature_type	USER-DEFINED	Feature Type
annotation	feature_id	USER-DEFINED	Depending on the annotation, this may be: Transcript ID (preferably using version number)
annotation	transcript_biotype	USER-DEFINED	The bare minimum is at least a description on whether the transcript is ['Coding', 'Noncoding']. Whenever possible, use ENSEMBL biotypes.
annotation	rank_	USER-DEFINED	Exon or Intron rank
annotation	hgvs_c	text	Variant using HGVS notation (DNA level)
annotation	hgvs_p	text	If variant is coding, this field describes the variant using HGVS notation (Protein level). Since transcript ID is already mentioned in 'feature ID', it may be omitted here.
annotation	cdna_pos	integer	Position in cDNA (one based)
annotation	cdna_length	integer	Trancript's cDNA length
annotation	cds_pos	integer	Position of coding bases (one based)
annotation	cds_length	integer	Number of coding bases (one based includes START and STOP codons)
annotation	aa_pos	integer	Position of amino acide (one based)
annotation	aa_length	integer	Number of amino acide (including START, but not STOP).
annotation	distance	integer	Distance to feature: All items in this field are options, so the field could be empty
annotation	errors_warnings_info	text	Add errors, warnings or informative message that can affect annotation accuracy. It can be added using either 'codes' or 'message types'. All these errors, warnings or information messages messages are optional.
