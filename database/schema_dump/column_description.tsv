annotation	feature_type	type_featuretype	Feature Type
annotation	feature_id	type_featureid	Depending on the annotation, this may be: Transcript ID (preferably using version number)
annotation	transcript_biotype	type_transcriptbiotype	The bare minimum is at least a description on whether the transcript is ['Coding', 'Noncoding']. Whenever possible, use ENSEMBL biotypes.
annotation	rank_	type_rank	Exon or Intron rank
annotation	hgvs_c	text	Variant using HGVS notation (DNA level)
annotation	hgvs_p	text	If variant is coding, this field describes the variant using HGVS notation (Protein level). Since transcript ID is already mentioned in 'feature ID', it may be omitted here.
