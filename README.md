# CoVEO

## Background

Covid-19 Data Portal variant browser application

CoVEO was developed by the VEO consortium and integrated within the Covid-19 Data Portal at EMBL-EBI (https://www.covid19dataportal.org/coveo). This includes an underlying PostgreSQL database which was updated with an unfiltered VCF and coverage file per sample processed in the systematically analysed dataset.

The CoVEO app presents an interactive visualisation on graphs and maps about the number of raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted by countries across the world and the distribution of variants across time. Users can even input an inclusion/exclusion list of mutations of the S protein, with the app showing the distribution of samples containing the custom-selected mutations across time grouped by country. By enabling focus on samples with sufficient sequencing depth on predefined positions, a unique approach is provided to users.
